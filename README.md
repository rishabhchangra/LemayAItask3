# Task 3- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATION

Steps for the Demo
- Clone the repository to your local machine  

- Optional Step- Create virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/myenv
```
  Activate the venv environment
  
  windows
```
\myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

mac
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

  Adding kernel to Jupyter Notebook
```
pip install --user ipykernel
```
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
```


- Launch Jupyter Notebook or any other python notebook IDE
- Open the file task3.ipynb
- Run all cells to view the analysis 

# Please explain why you have chosen this model as your demonstration?
I have chosen this model for demonstration because I have never worked on Text Data. During my academic projects I worked either with Numerical data or 
Image based data. So it was a good opportunity for me to explore the text analysis. I wanted to understand how we do the pre processing, what aspects of text data are important from Analysis perspective,
what kind of packages we use, what kind of issues can we run into and how do we resolve them. Text Sentiment Analysis or Natural Language Processing in general is an interesting domain and I want to explore more about it by working on different projects 
such as this. This task helped me get a slight peek into the subject and I am confident that I will explore the next steps in the process such as fitting a Machine Learning Model on the pre processed data.
